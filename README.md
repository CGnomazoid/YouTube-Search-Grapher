<h1>YouTube Search Grapher V0.02</h1>

<h2>What is this?</h2>
<p>This is a simple program that allows you to search YouTube and graph the results. It is written in Python and uses <a href="http://matplotlib.org/">matplotlib</a> to graph the data- as well as some other options</p>

<h2>How do I use it?</h2>
<p>First, you will need a Google Developer account which are easily granted by going to <a href="https://developers.google.com">YouTube's API Homepage</a>. I have not used the Google API Python library so no need to install it.</p>

<p>To make the code pretty I've used a program called Jupyter Notebook. You can install it by running

<code>pip3 install jupyter</code> 

in your terminal. You can then run the program by running

<code>jupyter notebook</code>

in the directory of the program or by using the VSCode extension.</p>
